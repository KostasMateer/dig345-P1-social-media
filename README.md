# About
This project was built using react. It is a social media website that allows
users to post anonymously. It is like YikYak, but with a catch - people do 
not understand what they post after it is sent. The app uses
Google Translate API, and translates it to the most popular languages:
Spanish,Chinese, Hindi, Arabic, Portuguese, Bengali, Russian, Japanese, 
Punjabi, German.
